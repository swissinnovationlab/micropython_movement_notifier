    The :class:`Soundboard` class handles all communication with the sound
    board via :ref:`UART <upy:machine.UART>`, making it easy to get
    information about the sound files on the sound board and control playback.

    If you need to reset the sound board from your MicroPython code, be
    sure to provide the ``rst_pin`` parameter. The sound board sometimes gets
    out of UART mode and reverts to the factory default of GPIO trigger
    mode. When this happens, it will appear as if the sound board has
    stoped working for no apparent reason. This library is designed to
    automatically attempt resetting the board if a command fails, since
    that is a common cause. So, it is a good idea to provide this
    parameter.
